So you ignored all the warnings and installed MysteryMemeware on your computer and now you are hopelessly stuck listening to the same song and staring at the same jpeg of a ghost until the end of time. Well here are a few solutions that might work, however, you are still legally responsible for any and all damages to your system and atempting to follow the instructions below is not a guarantee of success. Any and all damage is your responsibility and the following serves only as a guied to experienced users to attempt to recover their data.

# Method 1
Requires a soft version of MysteryMemeware.

Some versions of MysteryMemeware come with a built-in fail safe mechanism. If your copy of MysteryMemeware has the fail safe enabled you will see a small message in the bottom right corner of your screen encouraging the user to hold down the "X" key. If you see this message hold down the "X" key for 10 seconds or until your screen goes black. Once your screen goes black you are safe to release the "X" key. After your screen goes black MysteryMemeware will uninstall itself. This process may take several seconds. Be patient. Eventually your device will restart. After restarting your device should be back to normal.

# Method 2
Requires a second computer and a blank USB thumb drive with at least 8 gigabytes of storage.

The first step is to create a Windows 10 installer. To do this download the latest Media Creation Tool from Microsoft at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10. Run the media creation tool and follow Microsoft's instructions to create a bootable Windows 10 installer. Fully shut down the infected pc by holding down the power button for up to 20 seconds until you see a black screen. Then insert the USB flash drive you made. Turn on the infected PC and press the appropriate keys on your keyboard to enter the BIOS or bootload menu and select the appropriate option to boot from USB. Once inside the Windows 10 installer hold the shift key and press F10 this will open a command prompt window. From here type the following command exactly where C:\ is the letter of the infected drive "copy C:\MysteryMemeware\MysteryUninstaller.exe C:\MysteryMemeware.exe /y". Press the enter key to run this command. After running the command you should see the output "1 file(s) copied." if you see this message then you have successfully completed the hardest step. You can now fully power off the infected PC and remove the USB flash drive. Finally power on the infected PC. After booting up the infected computer will load for a long time while it uninstalls MysteryMemeware and then it will restart. After restarting you should be able to use your computer again as normal.

# Method 3
Requires a second computer and a way to connect an extra hard drive.

To repair your computer without a flash drive you will need to remove your computer's hard drive and attach it to another computer. MysteryMemeware will not spread to other hard drives even if you accidentally boot into the infected drive while attempting repairs. Start by shutting down the infected computer by holding down the power button for up to 20 seconds until you see a black screen. The remove the boot drive from the infected pc and connect it to the second computer. Boot up the second computer with the infected drive as a secondary drive. Navagate to the MysteryMemeware folder in the root of your secondary drive. Delete MysteryMemeware.exe then rename MysteryUninstaller.exe to MysteryMemeware.exe. After completeing these steps you should be able to plug your hard drive back into the original computer and turn it on. After booting up the infected computer will load for a long time while it uninstalls MysteryMemeware and then it will restart. After restarting you should be able to use your computer again as normal.
